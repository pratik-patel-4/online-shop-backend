## üöÄ Prompt: Build a Full-Fledged Online Shopping App Using Java, Spring Boot, Microservices, and PostgreSQL

I want to create a **complete, production-level Online Shopping Application** using a **Microservices architecture with Java and Spring Boot**, with **PostgreSQL** as the database. The purpose is to **solidify backend development skills** through a **no-skips, fully explained, step-by-step hands-on guide**, starting **from scratch all the way to deployment**.

### ‚úÖ Project Requirements:

1. **Give me a complete project roadmap first** ‚Äî breaking down everything I‚Äôll be doing at each phase.
2. Then guide me **step-by-step**, with:
    - Clear explanations
    - Actual code
    - Configuration files
    - REST endpoints
    - Data models
    - Testing where needed
    - Dockerization
    - Deployment instructions
    - Security and best practices
3. I‚Äôm using:
    - **Java 17**
    - **PostgreSQL** (installed and running)
    - IDE: IntelliJ or VS Code (you can assume IntelliJ)
    - OS: Ubuntu/Windows/Mac (cross-compatible setup preferred)

### üóÇÔ∏è Microservices Plan for the Application:

1. **User Service** - registration, login, JWT, user profile
2. **Product Service** - CRUD operations on products
3. **Order Service** - place order, get order history
4. **Payment Service** - payment handling, success/failure hooks
5. **Inventory Service** - stock updates, availability check
6. **API Gateway** - single entry point
7. **Service Discovery** - Eureka server
8. **Config Server** - central config management
9. **Notification Service (Optional)** - email or SMS on order confirmation or status change

üí° *Feel free to suggest additional services or enhancements (e.g., rating/review service, analytics, cart service) to make the app more complete and realistic.*

---

### üí• Goals:

- Real-world architecture
- Microservices best practices
- Clean, modular code
- End-to-end authentication with JWT
- CI/CD ready structure (optional bonus)
- Easily deployable (Docker + cloud deployment)
- Fully documented APIs (Swagger)
- Testing with JUnit & Mockito

---

Now, **please give me a complete roadmap first**, organized by phases like:

1. **Project Setup**
2. **Microservice Creation**
3. **Inter-Service Communication**
4. **Authentication & Security**
5. **Testing**
6. **Containerization (Docker)**
7. **Deployment**
8. **Final Testing and Polish**

Once you give the roadmap, guide me **step-by-step** ‚Äî no skips, and each step with code + detailed explanation.

Let me know when you're ready, and we can jump into Phase 1: **Project Setup**!
